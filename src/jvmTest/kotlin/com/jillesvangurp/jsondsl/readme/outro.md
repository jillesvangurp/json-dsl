## Multi platform

This is a Kotlin multi platform library that should work on most  kotlin platforms (jvm, js, ios, android, etc). Wasm will be added later, after Kotlin 2.0 stabilizes.

My intention is to keep this code very portable and not introduce any dependencies other than
the Kotlin standard library.
